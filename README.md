## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating README-Generator was to standardize the creation of common project files.
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to save time and effort.
By creating this app, I learned the following: node.js and the inquirer module.

Naturally, this README was created with this README-Generator!

## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>

Modules and packages required to be installed:

```shell
npm install inquirer
```

## Usage
<a name="usage"></a>

To run this application, type 'node index.js' at the command/shell prompt and answer the series of questions. The files generated by this application can be found in the './output' folder.

NOTE: Since this outputs to the './output' folder, do NOT create a file by the name of 'output' in the same folder. The files being generated WILL over-write any files with the same name within the './output' folder.
