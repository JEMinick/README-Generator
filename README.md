## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating README-Generator was to standardize the creation of common project files.
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to save time and effort.
By creating this app, I learned the following: index.js and the inquirer module.

Invoke this application by typing "node index.js" at the command prompt.  You will find the output located in the [./output] folder...
